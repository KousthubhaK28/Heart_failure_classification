# Heart_failure_classification
This repository contains the code and resources for the Heart Failure Disease Classification project. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies whether a patient has heart failure disease or not.

Project Overview

Heart failure is a serious condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and accurate classification of heart failure can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to build a reliable classification model using various machine learning techniques to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart failure.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed analysis and visualization to understand data distributions and correlations.
Modeling: Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of model parameters to enhance performance.
Deployment: Preparing the model for real-world deployment using relevant tools and frameworks.
Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes various health metrics and medical records of patients. Link to dataset
