# Heart Failure Disease Classification

This repository contains the code and resources for the Heart Failure Disease Classification project. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies whether a patient has heart failure disease or not.

## Project Overview
Heart failure is a serious condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and accurate classification of heart failure can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to build a reliable classification model using various machine learning techniques to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart failure.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Detailed analysis and visualization to understand data distributions and correlations.
- **Modeling:** Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation:** Comprehensive evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimization of model parameters to enhance performance.
- **Deployment:** Preparing the model for real-world deployment using relevant tools and frameworks.
